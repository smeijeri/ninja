#ninja

Ninja is a knockout component library based on bootstrap css.

##why ninja?

Both bootstrap and knockout are powerfull tools. But sometimes there can be a lot of ceremony in creating for instance a accordion UI.
Ninja aims to take a way some of this pain. 

Thanks to the knockout custom components things that used to take a lot of work are now a breeze.

##semantics

Next to trying to make things easier to define. Ninja tries to make bootstrap more semantic.
Because all components work from custom tags things like ```<div class="form-group">``` become ```<form-group>```

##getting started

To install the package;

``` bower install https://github.com/smeijeri/ninja.git ```

Or; 

``` bower intall ninja-js ```

The later for some reason that I don't understand doesn't install the dependencies.
